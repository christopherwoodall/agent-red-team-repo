# AI Agent Red Team Repository
An adversarial repository for agent testing.

## Overview
Unlike traditional chatbots, where the user converses with the system via a textbox, AI agents operate in a more complex environment. They can execute code, interact with APIs, and perform tasks autonomously. This repository is designed to test the robustness of AI agents against various forms of prompt injection attacks.
